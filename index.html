<p1 class="paragraf_2"> “There was only one catch and that was <b>Catch-22</b>, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. <i>Orr</i> was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would <mark>no longer be crazy</mark> and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.</p1>
